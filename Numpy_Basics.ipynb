One such feature is speed. When performing operations on large arrays NumPy can often perform several orders of magnitude faster than Python lists. This speed comes from the nature of NumPy arrays being memory-efficient and from optimized algorithms used by NumPy for doing arithmetic, statistical, and linear algebra operations."],"metadata":{"id":"LZzkeo_xc6TB"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Creating NumPy ndarrays:**\n","At the core of NumPy is the ndarray, where nd stands for n-dimensional. An ndarray is a multidimensional array of elements all of the same type. In other words, an ndarray is a grid that can take on many shapes and can hold either numbers or strings. In many Machine Learning problems you will often find yourself using ndarrays in many different ways. For instance, you might use an ndarray to hold the pixel values of an image that will be fed into a Neural Network for image classification.\n","\n","There are several ways to create ndarrays in NumPy. In the following lessons we will see two ways to create ndarrays:\n","\n","Using regular Python lists\n","\n","Using built-in NumPy functions\n","\n","In this section, we will create ndarrays by providing Python lists to the NumPy np.array() function, it is just a function that returns an ndarray.
